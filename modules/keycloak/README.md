# Keycloak
Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management solution for modern applications and services. It provides features like:

Single Sign-On (SSO): Users can log in once and access multiple applications without having to log in again.
Identity Brokering and Social Login: Keycloak allows authentication through social media platforms or external identity providers (like Google, GitHub, etc.).
User Federation: It can integrate with external user databases (like LDAP or Active Directory).
Centralized Management: Provides a central place to manage users, roles, and access control across applications.
OAuth2 and OpenID Connect Support: Supports modern authentication protocols, allowing secure access to resources.
Multitenancy: Keycloak supports multi-realm environments where each realm can manage its own user base, clients, and roles.
Keycloak is typically used in environments where thereâ€™s a need to manage identity, provide secure login, and integrate with various authentication protocols.
